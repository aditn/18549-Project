This is a simple text file to illustrate my idea of our user website.

The basic design for our user website includes two parts:
1. user
2. admin

Both parts will require login (identification).
Thus both parts will be able to:
    a. set their passwords/username

For 1. user, they can
    b. view their activities in a non-interactive way
    c. set the sensors to learning mode

For 2. admin, they can
    d. view all "chairs" activities
        d.1. A chair is simply defined by a set of sensors
        d.2. If in the case that any sensors are broken,
             it is still viewed as a chair, simply not complete.
             In this case, there will be demonstration of which sensor is not
             sending data.
    e. toggle monitoring mode
        e.1. monitoring mode is a mode at which admin can leave the website,
             and any 'illegal' activities will be reported to a preset mail
             address.
